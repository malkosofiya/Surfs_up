## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to examine temperature trends in the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The research was based on 1,700 observations for the months of June and 1,517 observations for the months of December between 2010 and 2017.

## Results

After completing the analysis, the following conclusions were established: 

* In June, the average temperature is calculated at 75 degrees, minimum of 64 degrees, and maximum of 85 degrees. In December the average temperature is calculated at 71 degrees, minimum of 56 degrees, and maximum of 83 degrees.

* The low standard deviation for both months suggests very little weather fluctuations (3.26 degrees in June & 3.75 degrees in December).

## Summary

Ultimately, the analysis was able to determine that overall, the weather in Oahu is stable with little disparity. This is a huge benefit to the surf and ice cream shop business as it allows for full year operations. Nevertheless, further analysis might be needed to strengthen this conclusion. For instance, it might be useful to determine precipitation rates. Additionally, analyzing data for wave swells and wind condition can also help understand overall weather patterns and predict business profitability.
